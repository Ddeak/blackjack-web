## Blackjack

Built using React. This is a small demo project that allows you to play a game of blackjack.

### How to run:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

### Testing:

- `yarn test`

## Developer notes:

Redux - This project uses redux for state managemnt. This is likely overkill, however it is something I am comfortable using at the moment.

My testing approach currently falls in line with how Kent C Dodds describes in this [blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests).
While I am not married to this style, I feel it works well for the apps I currently work on.
